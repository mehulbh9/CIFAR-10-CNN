# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python.

## Project Description

The `cifar10_CNN.ipynb` notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the process of building and training a CNN model for image classification. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, representing airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
